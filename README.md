# jcr_write_nextprev

Restores next / prev article buttons on Write panel for navigating quickly between adjacent articles.

The plugin uses a duplicate of the original function in the Textpattern core (deprecated from v.4.9 onwards) and thus works exactly as earlier Textpattern versions, adding previous and next article buttons at the bottom of the sidebar.

## Installation

Install and activate to show the buttons on the Write panel.
